Installing these vim setting is currently manual.  Steps required:
  sudo apt-get install git
  sudo apt-get install vim
  cd ~
  git clone https://github.com/huws/.vim.git
  echo "source ~/.vim/bashrc" >> ~/.bashrc

Set up ctags:
  sudo apt-get install ctags
  cd <project directory>
  ctags --recurse --exclude=.git

Set up cscope (INCOMPLETE!):
  sudo apt-get install cscope
  cscope -Rb
  vim
    :cs add cscope.out  (THIS NEEDS TO BE MOVED TO CONFIG SOMEHOW, AS IT NEEDS TO BE RUN EVERY TIME)
